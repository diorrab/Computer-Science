   	<p> This is a show that is highly underrated, and most people havent even heard of it. It is on Netflix and has a 92%
on rotten tomatoes. It was aired June 2009 to July 2016, it has 8 seasons. It is very entertaining to watch.</p>

If you are sensitive to some images, or things that happen in some medical practices, i don't recomment watching the video.
		
<p> Royal pains is a show about a man that make one moral decision in the ER to save a child instead of a rich man, so Hank lost it all. Months later, broken-hearted and shunned from the medical community, Hank goes for a weekend in the Hamptons with his brother Evan.  Crashing a party at a mega-mansion on the beach, Hank rushed to help when a guest requires medical attention that only one around to diagnose. The next morning,the word spread fast. Hank is summoned to another mansion…and then another jsut for his medical advice. Hank's career is revived, but in a way he didn't expect, he becomes the on-call doctor for the rich, famous and infamous. Anyone who's anyone in the Hamptons has a lawyer on retainer. Now meet the newest,hottest accessory – the concierge doctor.
